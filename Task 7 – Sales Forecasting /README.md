# 🛒 Task 7 – Sales Forecasting (Time Series Regression)

### 🎯 Objective
Predict **weekly retail sales** using historical data through **time series feature engineering** and **XGBoost regression**.

### 🧩 Key Steps
- Loaded and explored Walmart weekly sales data  
- Created time-based features (month, week, year)  
- Applied **XGBoost Regressor** for forecasting  
- Evaluated using MAE, RMSE, and R² metrics  
- Visualized actual vs predicted trends  

### 🧠 Results
- R² ≈ 0.9 (strong predictive performance)  
- Model effectively captured seasonal and temporal sales patterns
