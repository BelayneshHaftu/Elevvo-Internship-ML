# 🏦 Task 4 – Loan Approval Prediction

### 🎯 Objective
Build a **classification model** to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant characteristics.

### 🧩 Key Steps
- Cleaned missing values and encoded categorical data  
- Split data into training/testing sets  
- Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** and compared with **Logistic Regression**  
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix  
- Addressed class imbalance using **SMOTE (Bonus)**  

### 🧠 Results
- Achieved accuracy ≈ 85%  
- Balanced model performance across both approved and rejected cases  

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
Python • Pandas • Scikit-learn • Seaborn • Imbalanced-learn  

### 📊 Skills Demonstrated
Classification • Encoding • Handling Imbalanced Data • Model Evaluation
