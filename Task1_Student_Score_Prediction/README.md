# 🎓 Task 1 – Student Score Prediction

### 🎯 Objective
Develop a **Linear Regression model** to predict students’ exam scores based on their study hours.

### 🧩 Key Steps
- Imported and cleaned the dataset  
- Visualized relationships between study hours and exam scores  
- Split data into training and testing sets  
- Trained and evaluated a **Linear Regression model**  
- Compared performance with **Polynomial Regression**  

### 🧠 Results
- R² Score: 0.95 (strong positive correlation)  
- The model successfully predicts exam performance based on study hours.
